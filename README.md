# ConvertingNFAtoDFA
Implementing the classical algorithm for constructing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) equivalent to a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)
# Description 
The aim of the project is to convert NFA to DFA and then test if a given string is accepted by DFA or not.
# How to use 
TestNew2 java file is responsible for simulating the operation.
The input you should pass to the constructor NFAtoDFA should be semicolon-separated sequence of triples of states; each triple is a comma-separated sequence of states.
You need to pass to runningDFA() method a string of zeros or ones you need to pass it to the DFA.
